  <summary><strong>Hint:</strong> What's the difference?</summary>
  
  *   **ðŸ”§ App:** A tool that performs a specific task. It's a one-way transformation from input to output (e.g., summarising text).

  *   **ðŸ¤– Agent:** A system that works towards a goal. It makes decisions and adapts its plan to get there (e.g., managing a support ticket until it's resolved).

  The key is **decision-making**. If the system needs to decide *what to do next*, it's probably an agent.
